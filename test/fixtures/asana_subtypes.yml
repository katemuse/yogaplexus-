  description: "Lunges include Virabhadrasana or Warrior poses, named after the great warrior, Virabhadra.  In all variations, the front foot is front foot is parallel to side of the mat and the back foot arch is in line with front heel, angled 15\xC2\xB0-45\xC2\xB0 out. The front thigh spins externally to move the knee directly over the second toe.  The back spins thigh internally, and provided the stance is a lunge, the back heel and outer edge of the back foot ground firmly into the floor. Vira III and Ardrachandrasana balance on the front foot, but the Warrior principles remain the same.  Form I postures like Vira I and III steer the pelvis toward perpendicular to the line of the front thigh; which Form II posture open the pelvis toward the side edge of the mat.  In other lunges such as ashwa sanchalanasana or low lunge, the back heel is up and the metatarsal pushes evenly into the floor."
