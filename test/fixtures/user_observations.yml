  comment: I prefer to do child's pose with my arms over my head.  That way I stretch out my ribs.

  comment: ".. so is using this for a little hamstring stretch if you can place your hand firmly on the ground.  Or, make a horizontal line from the head to the reaching foot, remove the block and you have a wicked balance, strengthening like mad.  This pose has room to be many things to many people.  "

  comment: I hear this image constantly and used to use it myself. The problem is, if the back half of the pelvis is squeezed too flat, the corresponding hip joint is forced into an unnatural relationship between the femur head and the asa tabulum. Don't tuck, either! Send your tail toward the earth. Patty Townsend would even suggest freeing your tail and hollowing the groins. Not a bad idea at all.

  comment: It really helps to align the front heel with the arch of the back foot.  However common this pose is, it never ceases to amaze me how complex a set of actions it requires.  It can either integrate you or break you into a million pieces.  Start with the front knee straight and slowly slowly find your way to a deep lunge.  Don't force your back pelvic half too far forward.  We are animals not machines.
